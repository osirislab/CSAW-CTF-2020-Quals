__Description__ - Blind SQL Challenge with XOR Encryption Included

```
The professor who you've been chasing recently cleaned out his account.
See if you can recover anything from his database despite that.
You might have to warm up his system - don't worry, it thinks out loud sometimes.
FYI- The professor is very fluent in XOR and really likes 2 byte codes
