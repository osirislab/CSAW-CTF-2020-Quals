      <h3> The professor who you've been chasing recently cleaned out his account. <br>
        See if you can recover anything from his database despite that. <br>
        You might have to warm up his system - don't worry, it thinks out loud sometimes. <br><br><br>
        FYI - The professor is very fluent in XOR and really likes 2 byte codes </h3>
