Hey Fellow Coworker,

Heard you were coming into the Sacremento office today. I have some sensitive information for you to read out about company stored at <hash> once you are settled in. Make sure your a valid user!
Don't read it all yet since they might be watching. Be sure to read it once you are back in Columbus.

Act quickly! All of this stuff disappears on September 15th, 2020 at 5:32AM EST.

Totally Loyal Coworker
